1. Database is the pool of information that using sql is managed and called and organized as the categories relate to each other. IOW a program.
2. Human resources database is a pool of people and their information, or an actual collection of data.
3. Entity integrity is a constraint to keep attributes limited to one occurance.
4. Referential integrity is like a forein key that isnt constrained neccesarily on the table but can be once you change the table constraint.
5. A relation is a table.
6. Its not because the attributes are not atomic. Change it so that theres only 1 facCreds item on a row.
7. No because it has nonkey attributes that are dependent on only one primary key. Needs to have another table with just the Creds and another with Names.
8. No, you need to make another table for seperate zip codes and addresses and states because those attributes are not related to the rest.
9. OLTPs database focuses on data entry and not reporting. Its optimized for data inserts and deletes.
10. A schema is a container of objects like tables, views, and stored procedures. Schemas are optimized for security.
