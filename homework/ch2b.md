1. The order of execution of a query is FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING,
SELECT, and ORDER BY

2. The FROM clause specifies the name of the tables that you want to query

3. The WHERE clause filters the rows by specifying a predicate that only
returns rows where the expression is true.

4. The GROUP BY clause arranges the rows returned by groups determined by the 
element you specified.

5. The HAVING clause is a group filter. (just like how the WHERE clause is 
a group filter)

6. The SELECT clause specifies the attributes (or columns) you want to return
in the result table of the query.

7. The distinct keyword returns only the unique values for each columns.

8. The order by clause sorts the rows in the output for presentation purposes.

9. The limit clause is used in the SELECT statement to constrain the number 
of rows in a result set.

10. The top clause limits the number of results the query returns.

11. The offset clause tells sql how many rows to skip and the fetch clause
says how many of the following rows to filter.
